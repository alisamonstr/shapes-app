## How to run
```bash
yarn
yarn start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Implementation details

For this task, I only used 3 new dependencies:
```json
{
  "react": "^17.0.2",
  "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
  "styled-components": "^5.3.3"
}
```

I chose [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) to use styles as components.\
It makes code better to read, also it helped me to work easier with styles which are dependant from props.
